# CNSBS - The Cube Nation Simple Backup Script
This script was written to comfortably create backups of the cube-nation servers.

How to use:
1) Specity the location of your private key, the ssh port and the login credentials at the top of the script.
2) Run the script with either ./CNSBS.sh or sh CNSBS.sj
3) Select a server

Currently there's no option to back up everything, this will be implemented in a later version
